OVERSPEED PROJECT
LPC4088
The project's code and accompanying documentation provide a solution to protect a turbine from overspeed conditions, which can occur when the rotational speed of the turbine exceeds a specified maximum limit. This can potentially cause damage to the turbine or the equipment it powers.

The project appears to implement an overspeed protection system using the LPC4088 microcontroller and its peripheral interfaces, such as the Timer, UART, and Interrupts. The code is written in C and is intended to be compiled and run on the LPC4088 microcontroller.
